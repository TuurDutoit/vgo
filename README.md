# Overview

Note: unfortunately, the links below don't work. You have to select the corresponding file in the files overview above.
The reason seems to be that links only work in wikis. However, wikis are stored in separate repos,
so they don't fit nicely in the GitHub Classroom mold. I considered putting all information in a single README.md,
as is often done in other GitHub projects, but I felt the negative impact on readability far outweighed
the minor inconvenience of having to manually click on a different link.
